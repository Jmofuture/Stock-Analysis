We will use Company Quote from AZMN(Amazon) 

We just need to change the APPL URL to AZMN.

## Power BI

In the Power BI Get Data menu, look for the Web option.

In the menu we copy the URL, we can change the Ticker for the financial instrument we want, in this case we will use AMZN (Amazon), but it can be any, where it says YOUR APY we must delete that and place the Key that was assigned to us.

In the next screen click on Connect and the Power Query window will open with the loaded data, click on Close and Apply to load the data.

When loading we check in Data if loading was successful.

We will then use the historical data to obtain all the price variations suffered by the Stock.

We will use the daily price history, but we can choose minutes and hours, we copy the URL as we did before.

We repeat the previous steps to obtain the data from WEB We change to the Ticker we are using and enter the KEY, we will obtain the data we requested and Power Query will open.

We verify that the relationship between the two tables has been created, since the same Ticker (AMZN) or the one you have decided to use should have been generated automatically.
